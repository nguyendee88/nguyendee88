# 👋 Hi, I'm Dee Nguyen

**🏗️ Building real-time data systems at scale | Segment Engine Architect**  
I'm a backend-focused software engineer with over 14 years of experience building scalable systems, real-time data pipelines, and intelligent automation frameworks — powering millions of records daily with high resilience and low latency.

## 🚀 What I’ve Built

- 🧠 **Segmentation Engine** — built to handle **millions of records** across databases and user models with **complex logic evaluation**.
- 🧩 **Workflow System** — running **3,000+ deployed flows**, processing **100,000+ jobs/day**, built from scratch with **zero-collision extensibility**.
- 📊 **Custom Data Pipeline** — moving **800M+ weblog events/month**, designed for **high throughput & fault tolerance**.
- ⚙️ **Scalable Ingestion Framework** — processing **2M+ batch requests/day**, supporting real-time ingestion across **Facebook, Zalo, Email, SMS**.
- 🌐 **Webhook Processor** — capable of **dynamic response transformation** with flexible user-defined output structures.
- 📡 **Real-Time Event Channels** — including **Zalo, Facebook**, enabling live interaction + automation at scale.
- 🔌 **100+ Integrations** — including **Email, SMS, Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Webhooks, APIs**, and **custom ShortLink services**.
- 🛠️ **CI/CD Pipeline** — fully automated on Kubernetes using microservice-first architecture and GitOps principles.
