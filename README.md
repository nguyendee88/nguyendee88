# 👋 Hi, I'm Dee Nguyen

I'm a backend-focused software engineer with over 14 years of experience building scalable systems, real-time data pipelines, and intelligent automation tools.

## 🚀 What I’ve Built

- 🧠 **Segmentation Engine** capable of processing millions of records with complex logic across various databases and user models.
- 🧩 **Workflow System** designed from scratch — currently running 3,000+ deployed flows, 100+ active daily, and handling 100,000+ event-triggered jobs/day. Fully extensible without impacting existing integrations.
- 📊 **Custom Data Pipeline** processing 800M+ weblog records monthly with high throughput and fault-tolerance.
- ⚙️ **Scalable Ingestion Framework** managing over 2 million batch requests daily and handling millions of webhooks across Facebook, Zalo, Email, and SMS.
- 🌐 **Webhook Processor** capable of transforming and returning dynamic structured responses based on user-defined formats.
- 📡 Fully integrated event channels (e.g. Zalo, facebook) supporting real-time interaction and automation at scale.
- 🔌 Led development of 100+ third-party integrations: Email, SMS, Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Webhooks, API callbacks, and custom ShortLink services.
- 🛠️ Built a fully automated CI/CD pipeline on Kubernetes with microservice architecture.
